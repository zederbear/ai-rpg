# Rust Terminal RPG (AI-First, Human-Refactored)

## Overview
This project was a class assignment where we built a terminal-based RPG in **two stages**:

1. **AI-Only Version**  
   - Written entirely by AI based on my instructions.  
   - I was not allowed to type any code myself, only guide the AI with prompts.  

2. **Human-Refactored Version**  
   - Starting from the AI version, I cloned the project and continued development **without any AI help**.  
   - I could only rely on my own knowledge and the official Rust documentation.  
   - My job was to debug, clean up, and expand the AI’s baseline code.

This assignment let me compare **what AI can do automatically** vs. **what I can do by iterating and improving on it**.

***

## AI-Only Version
- Created entirely through prompting AI.  
- Implemented core RPG mechanics:  
  - Player stats (health, attack, defense).  
  - Turn-based battles.  
  - Leveling system.  
- Downsides:  
  - Code was verbose and sometimes inefficient.  
  - Some logic was buggy and needed correction later.  

***

## Human-Refactored Version
- Starting from the AI codebase, I rewrote and added features without AI.  
- Improvements included:  
  - Simplifying code structure to make it more readable.
  - Making it look better, it was difficult to tell ai to fix one specific tiny piece in a file that big
- By editing AI’s output, I learned how to **analyze, debug, and iterate** on a project from a messy baseline.

## Reflections
- **AI Strengths:** Quickly generated a working prototype with basic mechanics.  
- **AI Weaknesses:** Introduced bugs and unnecessary complexity, required strong direction, cant fix tiny things in a big file.  
- **Human Strengths:** Able to refine, simplify, and expand the game in meaningful ways once I understood the baseline.  

This project showed me that:  
- AI can be useful for scaffolding ideas.  
- But true understanding comes from **debugging, editing, and building on top of code myself**.
