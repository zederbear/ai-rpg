# This is the README file for a Cultivation Quest game written in Rust.

## About the Game

Cultivation Quest is a text-based RPG where you play as a martial artist or Qi cultivator on a journey to reach immortality. You'll explore the wilds, battle enemies, complete quests, and train your Qi to become more powerful.

## Gameplay

The game is divided into two main locations:

* **The Wilds:** Here, you can encounter enemies, find NPCs, and discover hidden items.
* **The Village:** Here, you can rest, buy equipment, train your Qi, attempt breakthroughs, and talk to NPCs.

As you progress through the game, you'll level up your character, improve your stats, and learn new abilities. Be careful though, because some choices can have permanent consequences!

The following dependencies are required to run the game:

* `rand` - for generating random numbers
