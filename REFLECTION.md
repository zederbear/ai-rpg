# Reflection
Since I was using rust (which is open source and therfore changes a lot), and chatGPT was last updated late 2023 on it's knowledge base, there was some things which it tried to use which were out of date making it harder to get it to do correct things.

---

Also I suspect there was probably better libraries to use for the terminal or if not then there was probably new functions in the cross term library which chatGPT did not know about.

It worked better on specific ideas if I gave it an idea to work off of. 
# Examples
- I told it to clear the text from the terminal and re render a new frame and instead of overwriting text, it would just do the same thing as the regular terminal clear command making it so you could scroll up and see previous frames.
- I then gave it an idea of how to do it and it worked better (although there were still bugs)

Overall I think I did a pretty good job getting the ai to make this program even with the few bugs there are.
